Rules
72 hours : The length of the Game Jam
           Do not worry about the timeframe, the grading will reflect the limits
Theme : Sufficiently general to allow for your creativity
        You will receive it a day before your chosen starting date
        The additional time can be used for planning and brainstorming
Genre, Mechanics, Style : Up to you! But keep to the theme…
Software : Generally anything goes, but:
           Use the Unity Engine - exceptions must be consulted beforehand!
           Prioritize open and free software, so that others may learn from your work
Platform : Completely up to you - WebGL, PC, Mobile, etc.
           Please consult more exotic platforms - e.g., Switch, GameBoy, Calculator
Assets : Create them by yourself or use external sources
         Do not create an Asset Store game, make it your original
         Credit any external sources you use
         Make sure to include license where appropriate
Teams : One person or many, this is up to you
        Team members need not attend this course
        Be sure to keep track of what you worked on
        The larger the team, the higher will be my expectation
Time : Complete your game prototype before the time limit runs out
       Keep in the spirit of Game Jam, the limited is important
       Submission may be posponed up to one day after the ending date
